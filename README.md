# Manual QA Testing
Project developed to earn the certificate for QA tester from CoderHouse

The present work aims to present the results of the functional tests performed by the student Marjorie Soares to obtain the Manual Software Tester Certificate - Testing QA Manual - from CoderHouse.

Tests were conducted, using appropriate methods and tools, to assess the performance and functionality of "Estante Virtual", a well-known Brazilian company in the virtual market of new and used books. The page was created in 2005 and acts as intermediary in the sale of books, having as collaborators any person or company that is able to sell books through its platform.

Due to the limited time available to perform a more complete analysis of the characteristics of the page, we have limited ourselves to evaluating three important sections of the platform: registration, search engine and product information. 20 test cases were performed.
API, performance, and accessibility tests were also conducted.
The tests were mainly carried out in the Chrome browser, since it is the  most used browser in Brazil.

Objectives
1. Report the results of the twenty test cases carried out in three sessions of the 
Platform: Login, Search and Products
2. Report incidents found 
3. Report API, performance, and accessibility test results
4. Summarize the results
5. Suggest improvements
